# Wix Store Fraud Detector

This **updated** project aims to detect fraudulent activity taking place in the Wix Store. This was made over the course of 1 week by Santosh after a hard pivot from the original project.

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository onto your computer
   ```$ git clone https://github.com/Soontosh/Wix-Tracker.git```
2. Install the necessary packages
   ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run the server locally
   ```$ python manage.py runserver```

## Additional Information

This section contains additional information regarding our project.

### Tech Stack

We use Django for backend, Railway for deployment, and Railway w/ PostgreSQL for our database. For the Discord bot, which is currently on a seperate repo, we use Discord.py.

Note: Only Santosh currently has access to the Railway db.

Our database is hosted on Railway w/ PostgreSQL. It is currently very simple and subject to change
